# 🎧 Headphones - A Responsive Webpage From Scratch

Welcome to the **Headphones** project! This is a fully responsive and accessible web page, designed and implemented from scratch using only **HTML and CSS**—no libraries, no frameworks.

## 💡 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **design and build a professional, accessible, and responsive webpage** using raw HTML and CSS, applying best practices in layout, styling, and interaction design.

I will:
- Design a clean and modern user interface using Figma
- Implement a design using semantic HTML and CSS only
- Follow accessibility and responsive design principles

## 🌐 Live Demo

🚧 *Coming soon: You can host this on GitHub Pages or Netlify for preview*


## 🖼️ Design

The UI is custom-designed in [Figma](https://figma.com), with layout planned around:
- A **12-column responsive grid system**
- Structured content blocks (Header, Hero, Main, Footer)
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Mobile-first approach with media queries for screens ≤ 480px
  

## 📱 Interactions & Responsiveness

This webpage includes the following interactive and responsive features:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Responsive Layout** | Switches to a mobile layout at screen widths of **480px or less** |
| 🔗 **Link Hover/Active** | Link text turns **`#FF6565`** when hovered or active |
| 🔘 **Button Hover/Active** | Buttons reduce opacity to **`0.9`** on hover or click |
| 📏 **Max Content Width** | Content area is limited to **1000px**, centered horizontally |
| ♿ **Accessibility** | Uses semantic tags and accessible color contrast ratios |
